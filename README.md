WebGL Instant Radiosity Through Virtual Point Lights
===============

What
---
This is my term project for 3D Computer Graphics, my teammate and I will be implementing instant radiosity into Three.js.

Instant radiosity is a global illuminatin technique that uses VPL's (Virtual Point Lights) to simulate light bounces in a 3D scene.

How
---
This application has the following dependencies, make sure they are installed on your system.

- Ruby, Gems, and Bundler
- Bash

To install:

- First run `bundle install`
- Then `bundle exec rake compile` to compile the coffeescripts into a js file.

You can also:

- Run `bundle exec rake watch` to run guard and have it compile files whenever you change something...
- Run `bundle exec rackup` to run a local server that serves the `bin/` directory.
